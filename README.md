# Training JS
Training Js is a personal project aimed to enhance my understanding of vanilla javascript. This repository will be the platform on which I explore various concepts in javascript, practicing new skills, testing new ideas, and building small projects to actualize what I have learned.

## Practical learning
I've been stuck in tutorial hell for far too long. I'm using this repository as a way to practice more and be able to share code snippets easily.

## How this project is organised (WIP)
Each concept will be kept in separate folders and branches, so the learning path and progress are easy to follow. Inside each folder, there will be a README file providing an overview and explanation of the respective concept/project.

I will complement each project with some theoretical knowledge obtained through research to have a holistic understanding of JavaScript and web development.
